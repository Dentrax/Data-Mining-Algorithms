## What It Is

**Data Mining Algorithms with C#**

Data Mining Algorithms guide for C# language is an easy and advanced way to learn how algorithms works in theory.

**Uses : `C# Language`** -> **[Official Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)**

**Who is the target audience?**

This course is meant for anyone who wants to learn some Data Mining Algorithms in C#. The examples are made with C# using LINQ.

* Warning : This course assumes you have some C# knowledge, and `does not teach C# itself.`

* Warning : These example tutorials are not a "How to Data Mine" or "How Data-Mining works" and will not teach "Data-Mining techniques"

## How To Use

Just research the **[main solution](https://github.com/Dentrax/Data-Mining-Algorithms)**.

## Requirements

* You should be familiar with .NET family
* You will need a text editor (like VSCode) or IDE (Visual Stuido)
* You will need a computer on which you have the rights to install .NET Framework

## About

Data-Mining-Algorithms was created to serve three purposes:

**Data-Mining-Algorithms is a basically Data-Mining learning repository which all mining-algorithms coded in C# language**

1. To act as a guide to learn Data Mining Algorithms with enhanced and rich content using `LINQ`.

2. To act as a guide to exemplary and educational purpose.

3. There is no any Data Structures guide coded in Go language on the internet.

## Branches

We publish source for the **[Data-Mining-Algorithms]** in single rolling branch:

The **[master branch](https://github.com/dentrax/Data-Mining-Algorithms/tree/master)** is extensively tested by our QA team and makes a great starting point for learning the algorithms. Also tracks [live changes](https://github.com/dentrax/Data-Mining-Algorithms/commits/master) by our team.
